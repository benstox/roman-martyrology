with child, her execution was deferred, according to
the laws, until after her delivery, and whilst she was
in labor she mourned, and when exposed to the
beasts, she rejoiced. With them suffered Revocatus, 
Saturninus, and Secundulus. This last died in
prison; all the others were delivered to the beasts.&mdash;
