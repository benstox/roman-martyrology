THE vigil of the holy apostles Peter and Paul.&mdash;At
Rome, pope St. Leo II.&mdash;At Lyons, in France, St.
Irenaeus, bishop and martyr, who, as is related by
St. Jerome, was the disciple of blessed Polycarp,
bishop of Smyrna, and lived near the time of the
Apostles. After having strenuously opposed the
heretics by speech and writing, he was crowned with
a glorious martyrdom, with almost all the people of
his city, during the persecution of Severus.&mdash;At
Alexandria, in the same persecution of Severus, the
holy martyrs Plutarch, Serenus, Heraclides, catechumen, Heron, neophyte, another Serenus, Rhais,
catechumen, Potamioena and Marcella, her mother.
Among them, the virgin Potamioena is particularly
distinguished. She first endured many most painful
trials for the preservation of her virginity, and then
cruel and unheard-of torments for the faith, after
which she and her mother were consumed with fire.
&mdash;The same day, during the persecution of Diocletian, St. Papius, martyr, who was scourged with
knotted cords, cast into a caldron of seething oil
and grease, and after other horrible torments, was
decapitated, and thus won an eternal crown.&mdash;At
Maestricht, St. Benignus, bishop and martyr.&mdash;At
Cordova, St. Argymirus, monk and martyr, who was
slain for the faith of Christ during the persecution
of the Arabs.&mdash;At Rome, St. Paul, pope and confessor.
