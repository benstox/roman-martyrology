AT Patras, in Achaia, the birthday of the apostle 
St. Andrew, who preached the gospel of Christ 
in Thrace and Scythia. Being apprehended by the 
proconsul &AElig;g&aelig;as, he was shut up in prison, severely 
scourged, and finally, being suspended on a cross, he 
lived two days on it, teaching the people. Having 
besought our Lord not to permit that he should be 
taken down from the cross, he was surrounded with 
a great brightness from heaven, and when the light 
disappeared he breathed his last.&mdash;At Rome, the martyrdom of the Saints Castulus and Euprepis.&mdash;At 
Constantinople, St. Maura, virgin and martyr.&mdash;Also, 
St. Justina, virgin and martyr.&mdash;At Saintes, the 
holy bishop Trojanus, a man of great sanctity, who 
shows by many miracles that he lives in heaven, 
though buried on earth.&mdash;At Rome, St. Constantius, 
confessor, who strongly opposed the Pelagians, and 
by enduring many injuries from them, gained a place 
among holy confessors.&mdash;In Palestine, blessed Zosimus, confessor, who was distinguished by sanctity 
and miracles in the time of the emperor Justin.
