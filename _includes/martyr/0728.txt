AT Rome, the martyrdom of St. Victor, pope and
martyr.&mdash;Also, at Rome, St. Innocent, pope and
confessor.&mdash;At Milan, the birthday of the holy martyrs Nazarius and a boy named Celsus. While the
persecution excited by Nero was raging, they were
beheaded by Anolinus, after long sufferings and
afflictions endured in prison.&mdash;In Thebais, in Egypt,
the commemoration of many holy martyrs who suffered in the persecution of Decius and Valerian. At
this time, when Christians sought death by the sword
for the name of Christ, the crafty enemy devised
certain slow torments to put them to death, wishing
much more to kill their souls rather than their
bodies. One of these Christians, after suffering the
torture of the rack, of hot metal plates and of seething oil, was smeared with honey and exposed, in the
broiling heat of the sun, with his hands tied behind
him, to the stings of wasps and flies. Another was
bound and laid among flowers, when a shameless
woman approached him with the intention of exciting his passions, but he bit off his tongue and spat
it in her face.&mdash;At Ancyra, in Galatia, the holy martyr Eustathius. After various torments, he was
plunged into a river, but being delivered by an angel,
was finally called to his reward by a dove coming
from heaven.&mdash;At Miletus, in the time of the emperor Licinius, the holy martyr Acatius, who completed his martyrdom by having his head struck off,
after having undergone different torments and been
thrown into a furnace, from which he came out uninjured through the assistance of God.&mdash;In Bretagne,
St. Sampson, bishop and confessor.&mdash;At Lyons, St.
Peregrinus, priest, whose happiness in heaven is attested by glorious miracles.
