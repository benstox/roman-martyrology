AT Constantinople, the birthday of St. Paul, bishop
of that city. For the Catholic faith, he was
often expelled from his see by the Arians, and restored to it by the Roman Pontiff, St. Julius. Finally, the Arian emperor Constantius banished him
to Cucusum, a small town of Cappadocia, where, by
the machinations of the Arians, he was barbarously
strangled, and thus departed for the heavenly kingdom. His body was conveyed to Constantinople
with the greatest honor, in the reign of emperor
Theodosius.&mdash;In Egypt, St. Licarion, martyr, who

deacon, Sabinian, Wistremundus, Habentius, and
Jeremias, monks.&mdash;In England, the abbot St. Robert, of the Order of Citeaux.
