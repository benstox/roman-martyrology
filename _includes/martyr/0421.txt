AT Canterbury, in England, St. Anselm, bishop and
Doctor of the Church, who was renowned for
sanctity and learning.&mdash;In Persia, the birthday of
St. Simeon, bishop of Seleucia and Ctesiphon. He
was arrested by order of Sapor, king of Persia, loaded with irons, and presented to the iniquitous tribunals. As he refused to adore the sun, and openly
and courageously bore testimony to Jesus Christ,
he was confined a long time in a dungeon with one
hundred other confessors, among whom were bishops, priests, and clerics of various ranks. Afterwards Usthazanes, the king’s foster-father, who had
been converted from apostasy by Simeon, endured
martyrdom with great constancy. The day after,
which was the anniversary of our Lord’s Passion,
the companions of Simeon whom he had feelingly
exhorted, were beheaded before his eyes, after which
he met the same fate. With him suffered also several
distinguished men: Abdechalas and Ananias, his
priests, with Pusicius, the chief of the royal artificers.
This last having encouraged Ananias, who seemed
to falter, died a cruel death, having his tongue drawn
out through a perforation made in his neck. After
him, his daughter, who was a consecrated virgin,
was put to death.&mdash;At Alexandria, the holy martyrs
Arator, priest, Fortunatus, Felix, Silvius, and Vitalis, who died in prison.&mdash;Also, the Saints Apollo,
Isacius, and Crotates, who suffered under Diocletian.&mdash;At Antioch, St. Anastasius Sinaita, bishop.
