AT Rome, St. Alexius, confessor, son of the senator Euphemian. Leaving his spouse untouched
the night of his marriage, he withdrew from his
house, and after a long pilgrimage returned to
Rome, where he was for seventeen years harbored
in his fatherâ€™s house as an unknown beggar, thus
deluding the world by a new device. But after his
death, becoming known through a voice heard in
the churches of the city, and by his own writing, he
was, under the Sovereign Pontiff, Innocent I., translated to the church of St. Boniface, where he wrought
many miracles.&mdash;At Carthage, the birthday of the
holy Scillitan martyrs Speratus, Narzales, Cythinus,
Veturius, Felix, Acyllinus, Laetantius, Januaria,
Generosa, Vestina, Donata, and Secunda. By order
of the prefect Saturninus, after their first confession of the faith, they were sent to prison, nailed to
pieces of wood, and finally beheaded. The relics of
Speratus, with the bones of blessed Cyprian and the
head of the martyr St. Pantaleon, were carried from
Africa into France, and religiously placed in the
basilica of St. John the Baptist at Lyons.&mdash;At
Amastris, in Paphlagonia, St. Hyacinth, martyr,
who died in prison after much suffering, under the
prefect Castritius.&mdash;At Tivoli, St. Generosus, martyr.&mdash;At Constantinople, St. Theodota, martyr, under the Iconoclast Leo.&mdash;At Rome, the demise of

in his writings.&mdash;At Venice, the translation of St.
Marina, virgin.
