THE birthday of St. Martin, pope and martyr. 
Because he had convoked a council at Rome, and 
condemned the heretics Sergius, Paul and Pyrrhus,

heretical emperor Constans, carried to Constantinople and banished to Chersonesus, where he ended 
his life, consumed with afflictions endured for the 
Catholic faith, and with a reputation for many 
miracles. His body was subsequently transferred to
