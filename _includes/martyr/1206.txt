AT Myra, the metropolis of Lycia, the birthday of 
St. Nicholas, bishop and confessor, of whom it is 
related, among other miracles, that, while at a great 
distance from the emperor Constantine, he appeared 
to him in a vision and moved him to mercy so as to 
deter him from putting to death some persons who 
had implored his assistance.&mdash;In Africa, in the persecution of the Vandals, and under the Arian king 
Hunneric, the saintly women Dionysia, Dativa, 
Leontia, a religious man named Tertius, &AElig;milian, a 
physician, and Boniface, with three others, who were 
subjected to numberless most painful torments for 
the Catholic faith, and thus merited to rank among 
the confessors of Christ.&mdash;In the same country, St. 
Majoricus, son of St. Dionysia, who, being quite 
young and dreading the torments, was strengthened 
by the looks and words of his mother, and becoming 
stronger than the rest, expired in torments. His 
mother took him in her arms, and having buried him 
in her own house, was wont to pray assiduously at 
his sepulchre.&mdash;The same day St. Polychronius, 
priest, who, in the time of the emperor Constantius, 
was attacked by the Arians and put to death while 
at the altar saying Mass.&mdash;At Granada, in Spain, the 
passion of blessed Peter Paschasius, martyr, of the 
Order of Mercedarians, and bishop of Jaen, whose 
festival is celebrated on the 23d of October, by order 
of pope Clement X.&mdash;At Rome, St. Asella, virgin, 
who, according to the words of St. Jerome, being 
blessed from her mother's womb, lived to old age 
in fasting and prayer.
