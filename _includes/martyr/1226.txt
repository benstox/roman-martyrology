AT Jerusalem, the birthday of St. Stephen, the first 
martyr, who was stoned to death by the Jews 
shortly after the Ascension of our Lord.&mdash;At Rome, 
St. Marinus, senator. In the time of the emperor 
Numerian and the prefect Marcian, he was arrested 
for the Christian religion, racked and torn with iron 
hooks like a slave, then thrown into a burning pan; 
but being delivered because the fire became like dew, 
he was exposed to the beasts without being injured 
by them, and finally being led again to the altar, the 
idols of which toppled over at his prayer, he was 
struck with the sword, and thus obtained the 
triumph of martyrs.&mdash;Also, at Rome, on the Appian 
road, the decease of pope St. Denis, who sustained 
many labors for the Church, and was renowned for 
his doctrinal writings.&mdash;In the same city, St. Zosimus, pope and confessor.&mdash;In Mesopotamia, St. 
Archelaus, a bishop celebrated for learning and 
sanctity.&mdash;At Majuma, St. Zeno, bishop.&mdash;At Rome, 
St. Theodore, sacristan of St. Peter's church, who is 
mentioned by the blessed pope Gregory.
